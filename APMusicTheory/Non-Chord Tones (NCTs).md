## Neighbor Tones and Passing Tones (NT & PT)
Can be:
- Chromatic (not part of the key)embellish
- Diatonic (part of the key)


```ad-important
If a non-chord tone **resolves to a weaker accentation**, the NCT is called **accented**.

If not, it is unaccented.
```

## Suspensions and Retardations (Sus & Ret)
1. Starts with the **preparation**
2. Then it gets **suspended** (or retarded)
	- A note stays on the old chord while the rest move to the new chord
3. Finally, the **resolution**

- They are named by interval of the root to the suspension, if the root is suspended, use the tenor instead
	- Compounds do not matter: do not put Sus 11-10
	- Exception is **Sus 9-8**
