# Secondary Functions
```ad-def
**Nonessential Chromaticism**: Chromatic NCTs
**Essential Chromaticism**: Chord tones that are outside the key
**Altered Chord**: Chord that uses notes outside the key (a type of essential chromaticism)
**Tonicise**: To use a tone as a temporary tonic for a few chords
```

- Written in the format of $x/y$, where $x$ is the chord inside the $y$ scale, like $V/V$ would be the dominant of the fifth scale
- The $V/V$ of $E^b$ ($BEA^b$) would be the dominant of the $B^b$ scale, which would be an $F$ triad, in the key of $B^b$ ($BE^b$) major
	- $FACE^b$, not $FA^bCE^b$, becase it uses the $Bb$ key


## Major
- You cannot tonicise to $I$ because it does nothing or $vii^o$ because you cant resolve to a diminished tonic
