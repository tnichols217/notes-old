## Aerobic respiration
#aerobic
$C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2 \rightarrow 6CO_2 + 6H_2O + 36ATP$
Glucose + Oxygen -> Carbon Dioxide + Water + Chemical Energy
- Cellular respiration is different from breathing
- Cellular respiration is a chemical reaction to break down glucose to release energy
- it is aerobic because of the presence of oxygen
- Each glucose produces 36 ATP, it is very effecient
## Anaerobic respiration
#anaerobic
$C_6H_{12}O_6 \rightarrow 2C_3H_6O_3 + 2ATP$
Glucose -> Lactic acid + Chemical Energy
- Very ineffecient, only produces 2 ATP
- When you accumulate lactic acid, it is called oxygen debt, because you owe oxygen to your body (lactic acid)
- Lactic acid is harmful to your body
- Is only used in emergencies to quickly make energy

$C_3H_6O_3 + 3O_2 \rightarrow 3CO_2 + 3H_2O$
Lactic acid + Oxygen -> Carbon Dioxide + Water
- Break down lactic acid by adding oxygen
- Does not produce any energy at all
- Aerobic process
