# DNA Replication
## Semiconservative Replication
- Each strand serves as a guide to replicate onto the other side
- Steps
	- Unwinding
	- Base pairing
	- Joining

## Unwinding
- Starts with the double helix
- **DNA helicase** starts to **separate** the two sides of the double helix
- Single Stranded Binding Proteins (**SSB**) associate with the DNA to **prevent it from joining back together**
