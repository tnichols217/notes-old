# Gene Regulation and Mutation
## Prokaryote Gene Regulation
- **Gene Regulation** is the ability of an organism to control which genes are transcribed in the response to the environment.

### Operons
```ad-definition
**Operon**: a section of DNA that contains the genes coding for proteins.
```

- Made up of:
	- **operator**: a segment of DNA that acts as an on/off switch for transcription
	- **promoter**: where the RNA polymerase first binds to the DNA
	- **regulatory gene**
	- **genes for coding proteins**

## Mutations
```ad-definition
**Mutation**: A **permanent change** or mistake **in DNA** that happens **during replication**
```
### Types of mutations
#### Point mutations

```ad-definition
**Point mutations**: A small mutation at a particular point only
```

1. **Substitution** - One base pair is exchanged for something else
	
	1. **Missense** substitution - DNA is altered to code for the **wrong amino acid**
	2. **Nonsense** substitution - DNA is **altered** to code **for a stop codon**
	3. **Silent** substitution - DNA is altered, although **produces the same amino acid**
		
2. **Frameshift** - One base pair is inserted or deleted, making **all pairs afterwards read incorrectly**
	
	1. **Insertion** - A base pair is added, making all base pairs afterwards shifted towards the end, this leads to the last base pair not making it into a codon
	2. **Deletion** - A base pair is deleted, making all base pairs afterwards shift forwards, this leads to the last codon missing a pair
		
3. **Duplication** - A codon is repeated, leading to the protein to be longer
	
	1. **Duplication** - A single codon is repeated **once**
	2. **Expending mutation** - A particular codon is repeated **several times**, repeating more and more over generations

#### Large mutations
```ad-definition
**Large mutation**: An entire portion of a chromosome being copied incorrectly

- Leads to large drastic effects on the expression of such genes

```

1. **Deletion**
	
	- A section of the chromosome is completely deleted
		
2. **Duplication**
	
	- A section of the chromosome is duplicated next to itself
		
3. **Inversion**
	
	- A section of the chromosome is flipped upside down, reversing the DNA
		
4. **Insertion**
	
	- A section of the chromosome is moved to a completely different chromosome
		
5. **Translocation**
	
	- A section of two completely different chromosomes are swapped

### Protein folding and stability
**Both small and large mutations** can cause **proteins to misfold**, making them function incorrectly
```ad-example
**Sickle blood cells**

- A single codon changes from **gutamic acid (GAA)** -> **valine (GUA)**
- This leads to the protein being folded incorrectly
```

### Causes of mutation
Small mutations may just happen spontaneously, sometimes DNA polymerase adds the wrong nucleotide.
