# Gene Regulation and Mutation
## Prokaryote Gene Regulation
- **Gene Regulation** is the ability of an organism to control which genes are transcribed in the response to the environment.

### Operons
- An **operon** is a section of DNA that contains the genes coding for proteins.
- Made up of:
	- **operator**: a segment of DNA that acts as an on/off switch for transcription
	- **promoter**: where the RNA polymerase first binds to the DNA
	- **regulatory gene**
	- **genes for coding proteins**

## Eukaryote Gene Regulation
### Controlling transcription

### Hox Genes

### RNA Interference

## Mutations
- A **permanent change** or mistake **in DNA** that happens **during replication**

### Types of mutations
1. **Substitution** - One base pair is exchanged for something else
	1. **Missense** substitution - DNA is altered to code for the **wrong amino acid**
	2. **Nonsense** substitution - DNA is **altered** to code **for a stop codon**
	3. **Silenemt** subsitution - DNA is altered, although **produces the same amino acid**
