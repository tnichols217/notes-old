# Gene Regulation and Mutation
## Prokaryote Gene Regulation
- **Gene Regulation** is the ability of an organism to control which genes are transcribed in the response to the environment.

### Operons
- An **operon** is a section of DNA that contains the genes coding for proteins.
- Made up of:
	- **operator**: a segment of DNA that acts as an on/off switch for transcription
	- **promoter**: where the RNA polymerase first binds to the DNA
	- **regulatory gene**
	- **genes for coding proteins**
