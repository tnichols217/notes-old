# Genetic Material

## Mendel's work was rediscovered
- In the 1900s, people **already knew** that genetic info was **stored in the chromosomes**
- They **did not know** whether the info was **stored in the protein or the DNA** (nucleic acid), since chromosomes were made of both

## Griffith
- Griffith's experiment was on **two strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae**
- The two strains were (**S**)mooth and (**R**)ough
- S had a sugar coat on it, and caused pnemonia
- Griffith's observations
- 
| Smooth Strain | Rough Strain   | Dead Smooth Strain | Dead Smooth Strain + Rough Strain |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Mouse died    | Mouse Survived | Mouse Survived     | Mouse Died                        |
- He concluded that live **R strains can be transformed into S strains**

## Avery
- Avery tested what part of the S strain turns the R strain into an S strain
- He tested:
	- DNA
	- Protein
	- Lipids
- He found that only the **DNA made the R strand turn into an S strand**
- He theorized that the **DNA from the S strand leaked** and the **R strand picked it up and replicated it**, creating live S strands

## Hershey and Chase
