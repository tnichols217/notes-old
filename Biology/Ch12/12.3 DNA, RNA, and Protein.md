# DNA, RNA, and Protein
## Central Dogma
- DNA -> RNA -> Protein
### RNA
| RNA             | DNA             |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| Uracil          | Thymine         |
| Single stranded | Double stranded | 

There are most commonly three types of RNA:
1. Messenger RNA (mRNA)
	- Form complementary to a single strand of DNA
	- Travel from Nucleus to Ribosome to instruct it to create proteins
2. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
	- Associates with proteins to form ribosomes
3. Transfer RNA (tRNA)
	- Smaller RNA
	- Transports amino acids to the ribosome
