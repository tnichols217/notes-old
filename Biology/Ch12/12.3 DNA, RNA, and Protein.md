# DNA, RNA, and Protein
## Central Dogma
- DNA -> RNA -> Protein
### RNA
| RNA             | DNA             |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| Uracil          | Thymine         |
| Single stranded | Double stranded | 

There are most commonly three types of RNA:
1. Messenger RNA (**mRNA**)
	![[Pasted image 20220122150954.png]]
	- Form complementary to a single strand of DNA
	- Travel from **Nucleus to Ribosome** to instruct it to create proteins
2. Ribosomal RNA (**rRNA**)
	![[Pasted image 20220122151014.png]]
	- Associates with proteins to **form ribosomes**
3. Transfer RNA (**tRNA**)
	![[Pasted image 20220122151024.png]]
	- Smaller RNA
	- **Transports amino acids** to the ribosome

### Transcription
In Transcription, **DNA is transcribed into mRNA**
- Happens **in the nucleus**
- After DNA is unzipped, **RNA Polymerase** binds to a strand to DNA and creates the **mRNA in the 3' -> 5' direction (on the DNA)**
- The strand of DNA that's used to make the RNA is called the **template strand**
	- The other is called the **nontemplate strand**
- After creation is done, it will **leave the nuclear membrane** into the cytoplasm

### RNA processing
- After the mRNA is made from the DNA, some of the sequence is not needed
	- Unneeded sections are called the **introns**
	- Needed sections are called **extrons**
- Before leaving the nucleus
	- Introns are removed
	- **Protective cap** added on the 5' side
	- **Long sequence of A's** added to the end (3' side)
- Sometimes unprocessed RNA is called **pre-mRNA** (in eukaryotic cells)

## The Code

- Hypothesised that protein synthesis instructions are stored in the DNA
- There are **20 types of amino acids**, so there must be more than 20 combinations of DNA
- Later it was found that **three-base codes** were what encoded DNA (giving 64 combinations)
- Group of three pairs is called a **codon**

### Translation
1. mRNA's 5' end connects to the ribosome
2. tRNA folds into a clover leaf shape
3. tRNA is activated by an enzyme that attaches an amino acid to the 3' end
4. In the middle of the tRNA there is an anticodon (codon complementary to a codon on the mRNA)

### The role of the ribosome
- The ribosome is made of two parts and are not connected when protein translation is not happening
- Contains three grooves: E, P, A
1. Once the mRNA associates with the ribosome, a tRNA with anticodon CAU will bind to the AUG (start) codon in the mRNA (5' end)
2. Then another tRNA will attach in the A groove with an anticodon to the next codon on the tRNA, carrying its 
3. the rRNA in the ribosome catalyses the two tRNAs to join into the E site
