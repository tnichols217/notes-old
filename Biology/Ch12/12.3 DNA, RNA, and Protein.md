# DNA, RNA, and Protein
## Central Dogma
- DNA -> RNA -> Protein
### RNA
| RNA             | DNA             |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| Uracil          | Thymine         |
| Single stranded | Double stranded | 

There are most commonly three types of RNA:
1. Messenger RNA (**mRNA**)

	- Form complementary to a single strand of DNA
	- Travel from **Nucleus to Ribosome** to instruct it to create proteins
2. Ribosomal RNA (**rRNA**)

	- Associates with proteins to **form ribosomes**
3. Transfer RNA (**tRNA**)
	![[Pasted image 20220122151024.png]]
	- Smaller RNA
	- **Transports amino acids** to the ribosome

### Transcription
In Transcription, DNA is transcribed into mRNA
- Happens in the nucleus
- After DNA is unzipped, RNA Polymerase binds to a strand to DNA and creates the mRNA in the 3' -> 5' direction (on the DNA)
- The strand of DNA that's used to make the RNA is called the template strand
	- The other is called the nontemplate strand
- After creation is done, it
