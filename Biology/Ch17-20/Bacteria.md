# Bacteria

## Prokaryotes
- Microscopic
- Unicellular
- Circular DNA
- Some have a capsule
	- Helps protect cell
	- Prevents drying out
	- Helps attach to other cells
- Some have *pili* (hair)

### Lysogenic Cycle
1. A cell is infected
   (for a phage, it injects DNA)
2. DNA circularizes
3. Enters the **Lysogenic Cycle**
4. DNA integrates with the chromosomal DNA
5. When cell division occurs, the modified DNA gets replicated as well
6. After some time, the infected DNA will separate again and enact its function later (could be months to decades)
