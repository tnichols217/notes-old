# Bacteria

## Prokaryotes
- Microscopic
- Unicellular
- Circular DNA
- Some have a capsule
	- Helps protect cell
	- Prevents drying out
	- Helps attach to other cells
- Some have *pili* (hair)

## Reproduction
### Binary Fission
> [!def] Binary Fission
> 
> **Binary Fission**: Division by getting larger then separating into two identical cells.
- Similar to cell division
- Can happen as fast as in 20 minutes

### Conjugation
> [!def] Conjugation
> 
> **Conjugation**: Two cells attach and exchange genetic information
- increases genetic diversity
