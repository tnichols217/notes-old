# Classification
```ad-def
**Classification (taxonomy)**: arrangement of organisms into orderly groups based on their similarities

**Taxonomists**: scientists that identify and name organisms
```

## Early Methods of Taxonomy
### Aristotle's System
- Aristotle is believed to be the first taxonomist
- He classified living things first as plants or animals, it looks something like:

```ad-info
title:Aristotle's system
- Animal
	- Bloodless (Invertebrates)
		- Land
		- Water
		- Air
	- Blodded (Vertebrates)
		- Land
		- Water
		- Air
- Plant
	- Herbs
	- Shrubs
	- Trees
```

#### Criticisms of Aristotle's System
- Aristotle's system was good for categorizing, but did not account for evolutionary relationships
- Some organisms did not fit well into this system

### John Ray's System
- Was a botanist
- **First person to use Latin** for naming
- The names were very long as specific

### Linnaeus's System
- Linnaeus was a Swedish naturalist who lived from 1707â€“1778
- He broadened Aristotle's System and formalized it into a **scientific system**
- His system also focused on an organism's **structure**
- His system was the **first formal system** of taxonomic organization
- Developed the modern day naming system, the **two-name system** (Genus & species)
- Also known as the **Father of Taxomony**
- Developed **Binomial Nomenclature**, which differed from Aristotle's system

#### Binomial Nomenclature
- Two-name system, Genus and species
- Uses Latin because it is an old, unchanging language
- Always italicized or underlined
- Genus is capitalized, but not species
- Names are made to a central organization to prevent duplicate names

## Classification Groups
```ad-def
**Taxon  (taxa)**: a category into which related
```
- A hierarchy of taxa exists from broadest to most specific
```ad-info
title:Hierarchy of taxonomic taxa
- Domain
	- Kingdom
		- Phylum
			- Class
				- Order
					- Family
						- Genus
							- Species

Can be remembered with the phrase:
**Dumb King Phillip Came Over For Gooseberry Soup!**
```
