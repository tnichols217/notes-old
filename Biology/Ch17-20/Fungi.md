# Fungi
- Most are multicellular
- Cell wall has *chitin*

## Structure
- **Hyphae**- Strings that make up the basic shape and structure
- **Mycelium**- Netlike mass of hyphae (underground)
- **Fruiting body**- Reproductive structure (visible to us above ground)
- **Cross walls**- hyphae can be dived into cells by walls called septa
	- Have hole to allow transport along th hyphae

## Nutrition
- Saprophytic: decomposers that recycle nutrients
- Parasitic: absorb nutrients from the living cells of hosts
-  Mutualistic: work with another organism to help
each other out (soybean: fungus gets sugar from
the plant, while providing more surface area for
absorption on the plant roots)
