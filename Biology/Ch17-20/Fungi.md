# Fungi
- Most are multicellular
- Cell wall has *chitin*

## Structure
- **Hyphae**- filaments that make up a fungiâ€™s basic structure
- **Mycelium**- netlike mass of hyphae
- **Fruiting body**- reproductive structure (visible to us above ground
- **cross walls**- hyphae can be dived into cells by walls called septa
  septa have holes for materials to pass through
