# Fungi
- Most are multicellular
- Cell wall has *chitin*

## Structure
- **Hyphae**- Strings that make up the basic shape and structure
- **Mycelium**- Netlike mass of hyphae (underground)
- **Fruiting body**- Reproductive structure (visible to us above ground)
- **Cross walls**- hyphae can be dived into cells by walls called septa
	- Have hole to allow transport along th hyphae

## Nutrition
- **Saprophytic**: Decomposers that recycle nutrients
- **Parasitic**: Absorb nutrients from the living cells of hosts
-  **Mutualistic**: Work with another organism to help each other out

## Reproduction
- **Budding**: Asexual reproduction where a daughter cell grows while attached to the parent cell
- **Fragmentation**: The mycelium gets disconnected, creating two
- **Spore Reproduction**: Asexual and sexual where a spore(haploid) is created and can continue to mature into a hyphae without gamettes.
	- May have sporangium (a case to protect the spore)
