# Fungi
- Most are multicellular
- Cell wall has *chitin*

## Structure
- hyphae- filaments that make up a fungiâ€™s basic structure
- mycelium- netlike mass of hyphae
- fruiting body- reproductive structure (visible to us above ground
- cross walls- hyphae can be dived into cells by walls called septa
  septa have holes for materials to pass through
