# Fungi
- Most are multicellular
- Cell wall has *chitin*

## Structure
- **Hyphae**- Strings that make up a fungi’s basic structure
- **Mycelium**- netlike mass of hyphae
- **Fruiting body**- reproductive structure (visible to us above ground
- **Cross walls**- hyphae can be dived into cells by walls called septa
  septa have holes for materials to pass through
