## 10.2 Mendelian Genetics
1. Explain the significance of Mendel's experiments to the study of genetics.
2. Summarize the law of segregation and law of independent assortment.  
3. Predict the possible offspring from a cross using a Punnett square/genetic diagrams. 

Answers:

- Gregor Mendel found a few interesting things while he was breeding his pea plants as a hobby
- The two most notable conclusions are his two Laws of inheritance
	1. **Law of Segregation**
		- Each offspring will **only recieve one** of each gene from each parent
		- This leads to a "blend" of the parents in the child, this leads to genetic variation in the offspring due to recieveing different genes from each parent
	2. **Law of Independent Assortment**
		- All genes are inherited independently of each other
		- Means that eye color does **not** effect your skin color for example
			- Ex:
				- Q: If your parents both have heterozygous alleles for cleft chin (Pp) and heterozygous for hair texture (curly dominant) (Cc) and you know the child has a cleft chin, what is the probablility of having straight hair?
				- A: Because of Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment, knowing anything about his cleft chin does not tell us anything about his hair texture, so this information can be ignored.

					|hair texture|C|c|
					|-|-|-|
					|C|CC|Cc|
					|c|Cc|cc|
				- The probability of having curly hair is **25%**
				- EXTRA: To verify the law of Independent Assortment, we can conduct a dihybrid cross

					|hair texture and cleft chin|PC|Pc|pC|pc|
					|-|-|-|-|-|
					|PC|PPCC|PPCc|PpCC|PpCc|
					|Pc|PPCc|PPcc|PpCc|Ppcc|
					|pC|PpCC|PpCc|ppCC|ppCc|
					|pc|PpCc|Ppcc|ppCc|ppcc|

					Phenotypes:

					|hair texture and cleft chin|PC|Pc|pC|pc|
					|-|-|-|-|-|
					|PC|PC|PC|PC|PC|
					|Pc|PC|Pc|PC|Pc|
					|pC|PC|PC|pC|pC|
					|pc|PC|Pc|pC|pc|

				- Restating: given cleft chin (phenotype **p**)
				- There are 4 possibilities with cleft chin 
					- **pC**, **pC**, **pC**, **pc**
				- Out of these four possibilities, only one has straight hair (**pc**)
				- We get a result of **25%**, the same as when we use the Law of Independent Assortment 

		- If this law is not true, it means if you had black hair for example, you would know that you would more about which eye color you would have
