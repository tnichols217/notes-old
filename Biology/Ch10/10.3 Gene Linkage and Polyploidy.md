# Gene Linkage and Polyploidy
## Genetic Recombination
Genetic Recombination is the action of recombining DNA with some random modifications

Factors that influence the randomness include
- The random arrangement of chromosomes when they line up for meiosis
- Crossing over at random points in the chromosome

## Gene Linkage
Genes that travel close to each other on the chromosome during meiosis may sometimes be linked.

- Linked genes influence each other and do not segregate independently
- This is an exception to Mendel's Law of independence
- Crossing over more often happens between genes that are further away on the chromosome

## Polyploidy
Polyploidy is when you have more than two copies of a chromosome in each cell. 

- The word may sound similar to diploid
- Diploid has two copies of each chromosome, but poly has 3 or more
- Coffee for example has 4, sugar cane has 8

## Codominance
When two genes are equally dominant, and when you have two different codominant genes, you get a
