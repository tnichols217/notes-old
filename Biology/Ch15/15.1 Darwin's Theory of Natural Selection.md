# Darwin's Theory of Natural Selection

```ad-info
title: Story
Darwin was a natuyralist who was on a voyage to collect specimens focused on south America.
It took 5 years.
He noticed that there were fossils of marine life high in the mountains.
He found giant fossil versions of smaller living animals.
He notices how earthquakes can lift rocks far and quickly.
There was a great variety of life on the Galagapos Islands.
Theorized that they migrated from the mainland to the islands.
Then they developed different beaks.
Darwin returned, had a conversation and hypothesized on why this happens.

**Artificial Selection**: Something chooses desirable traits, in hopes that offspring will have those traits.

```ad-def
**Natural Selection**: Over time, organisms will adapt to their environment.

Requirements:
1. Variation - They differ from each other
2. Heritability - Variations are inherited
3. Overproduction - Too many of a species, so they much compete to survive
4. Reproductive advantage - Have a higher chance of reproducing and living given the circumstances.
