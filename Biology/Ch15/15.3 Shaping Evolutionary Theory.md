# Shaping Evolutionary Theory
## Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium
```ad-def
A population's allele and genotype frequencies are constant

### $p+q = 1$
- where $p$ is the frequency of the dominant allele and $q$ is for the recessive

Held true unless there is some type of evolutionary force acting upon them

Requirements:
1. No Selection
2. No Mutation
3. No Migration
4. Large Population
5. Random Mating

Can be expanded to genotypes as well

### $p^2+ 2pq + q^2 = 1$

```

- If the requirements for Hardy-Weinberd equilibrium are held, then there will be 
	- Genetic equilibrium
	- No evolution

## Mechanisms of Evolution
### Genetic Drift
```ad-def
Changes in allelic frequency due to chance
Most commonly attributed to lack of population size
```
- Genetic Diversity is lost, leading to a change in the allelic frequencies
- Random chance makes a big change when the population is small because a single change effects the frequency of the entire population on a larger scale
	- Ex: If you have 50 black beetles and 50 brown beetles
		- If one black beetle dies, the ratio is still $49:50$ or $4.9:5$ beetles
	- If there were 5 black beetles and 5 brown beetles
		- Although the Initial ratio is the same, $1:1$, a change would greatly change the ratios
		- If one black one died, the ratio becomes $40:50$ or $4:5$

#### Bottleneck effect
- Occurs when a population shrinks to a small size, then rebounds
- Random chance effects the frequencies, and when it rebounds, the frequencies are stuck different

#### Founder effect
- A group moves out to start their own population and are separate from the previous population
- Since the group moving out tends to be small, random chance has great effect, leading to genetic drift

### Gene Flow
```ad-def
Transfer or alleles or genes from one population to another
```
- Caused by migration

### Non-random Mating
```ad-def
When mating is not completely random.
```
- Causes include:
	- Visual stimulation
	- Sounds
	- Smells
	- Strength

### Mutations
```ad-def
Random change in genetic Material
```
- Happens completely randomly
- Happens in Eukaryotes on average 0.003 per genome per generation
- Typical Gene mutates on average once every 1000 cell divisions

### Natural Selection
```ad-def
Nature selects the individuals best adapted for survival and reproduction by their allele
```
Types:
1. Stabilizing Selection
	- Eliminates extremes of a trait and the average trait leads to higher fitness
2. Directional Selection
	- Where one extreme is selected for, leading to keep going in the extreme direction
3. Disruptive Selection
	- Either extreme is favored
4. Sexual Selection
	- Acts on an organism's ability to find and mate

## Reproductive Isolation
### Prezygotic isolation
```ad-def
Prevents reproduction by making fertilization unlikely
```
### Postzygotic isolation
