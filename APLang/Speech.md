## **Why I Use Linux**

Why I use Linux and why mac and windows just kinda suck in comparison

But first off, what is Linux? Linux is a kernel (the thing that connects your hardware to the software running on your computer), build upon the GNU utilities. It is not an operating system, but operating systems can be build on top of Linux, like Ubuntu, or Arch Linux, which is what I use.

### **Philosophy**
Tech should be free and open

````col
```col-md
- Data should be **portable**
	- "Everything is a file"
- **Small** is beautiful
	- Each thing does one thing well
- You should have full **control**
	- Data is transparent
```
````

%%
Alright lets start off with what makes Linux different.
Fundamentally in the overarching philosophy of Linux, the main ideas are **portability** and **simplicity**, but also as a side effect, **control**.
Portability simply means that something can be taken from something and put into another. Practically, it means that everything works in a more modular type approach.
This means that almost any part of the system can be swapped out for something else if you don't like it. Don't like the program that loads your computer when you turn it on? Just change it. Don't like how your desktop looks? Install one that looks like a Mac or make it look like windows if you want to. 
This principle is best known in a popular quote in the Linux community "Everything is a file". In Linux, your physical hardware and whats in your computer are simply represented as files on your computer. Want to access something? Open the file. Not only does making everything a file allow ease of access to everything, but also functions as a way for completely different programs to communicate to each other: through files.
This principle also carries down into programs that you would use on your computer. All data stored, with respect to the Linux philosophy, is interchangeable and transferable across all programs of its calibre. This means that any word processor (like google docs), of course following the Linux philosophy, would save the files in the same format.

### **Technical Superiority**
How Linux is powerful yet lightweight

#### MacOS
Install: 16-35GB
Boot time: 12s
```
```col-md
#### Arch Linux
Install: 1-5GB
Boot time: 5-8s

- Optimised and modular architecture
- Industry Gold standard

Next is simplicity. As I mentioned earlier, a modular approach is taken to handle portability. However, it too plays a role in simplicity as well. Each program should have one function and one function only. This allows that one program to get not only extremely good at that one thing, but also be small and optimised. This plays a large role in Linux's efficiency and speed in such a small package.

### **Open Source Community**
and why you should be a part of it

- Security
- Speedy Development
- Clean and optimised code

%%
Lastly, is control. In Linux, everything is under your own control if you want to. You could delete your whole computer in one command if you wanted to and nothing but yourself would stop you. But in Linux, everything is open sourced, this means that the original code is open for anyone to read and fix, contrary to how Mac has all of this hidden. Having open source code allows you to verify that what you want to be running is actually running and nothing extra, like data collection or ads.

Other benefits of Open Source code include having a highly secure system, because all the code can be reviewed and fixed by anyone who wants to contribute. As compared to other operating systems where the code cannot be seen and will be hard to discover and fix a problem when it arises.

Open source code also promotes good coding procedures, like using code wisely and make it work well. If no one ever sees the code, such as in a proprietary manner like Mac, once something works it will likely never get looked at again or made better, since the coders are merely paid to make the code work and nothing more.

and never looked back since

### **Why Mac just isn't that good**

- Macs have a lot of bloat and features that you won't use
- There is a lack of customisation
- Requires expensive hardware to even access
- Limiting in terms of the variety of of things you can do with your system
