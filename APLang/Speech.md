### Philosophy
Tech should be free and open

Alright lets start off with what makes Linux different.
Fundamentally in the overarching philosophy of Linux, the main ideas are **portability** and **simplicity**.
Portability simply means that something can be taken from something and put into another. Practically, it means that everything works in a more modular type approach.
This means that almost any part of the system can be swapped out for something else if you don't like it. Don't like the program that loads your computer when you turn it on? Just change it. Don't like how your desktop looks? Install one that looks like a Mac or make it look like windows if you want to. 
This principle also carries down into programs that you would use on your computer. All data stored, with respect to the Linux philosophy, is interchangeable and transferable across all programs of its calibre. This means that any text editor, of course following the Linux philosophy, would save the files in the same format.
Next is simplicity. As I mentioned earlier, a modular approach is taken to handle portability. However, it too plays a role in simplicity as well. Each program should have one function and one function only. This allows that one program to get not only extremely good at that one thing, but also be small and optimised. This plays a large role in Linux's effecien

### Technical Superiority
How Linux is powerful yet lightweight

````col
```col-md
MacOS Install size:
16-35GB
```
```col-md
Arch Linux Install size:
5GB (800MB)
```
````

- Optimised and modular architecture
- Industry Gold standard
- (Windows isn't even on the list for obvious reasons)

---
### Open Source Community
and why you should be a part of it

- Security
- Speedy Development
- Clean and optimised code

---
### How I came to know Linux
and never looked back since

---
### Why Mac just isn't that good

- Macs have a lot of bloat and features that you won't use
	- Space
	- Speed
- 

---
### Why Windows kinda sucks

---
### Conclusion

---
- Philosophy
	- The Arch Philosophy
- Technical Superiority
	- Alternatives
	- Modularity
- Open Source Community
- Personal Example (how Linux changed my life)
- Dis Windows
- Conclusion
