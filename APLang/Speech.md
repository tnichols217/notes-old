Why I use Linux and why mac and windows just kinda suck in comparison

But first off, what is Linux? Linux is a kernel (the thing that connects your hardware to the software running on your computer), build upon the GNU utilities. I

### Philosophy
Tech should be free and open

````col
```col-md
- **Small** is beautiful
	- Each thing does one thing well
- Data should be **portable**
	- Everything is a file
```
```col-md
- You should have full **control**
	- Data is transparent
```

%%
Alright lets start off with what makes Linux different.
Fundamentally in the overarching philosophy of Linux, the main ideas are **portability** and **simplicity**, but also as a side effect, **control**.
Portability simply means that something can be taken from something and put into another. Practically, it means that everything works in a more modular type approach.
This means that almost any part of the system can be swapped out for something else if you don't like it. Don't like the program that loads your computer when you turn it on? Just change it. Don't like how your desktop looks? Install one that looks like a Mac or make it look like windows if you want to. 
This principle also carries down into programs that you would use on your computer. All data stored, with respect to the Linux philosophy, is interchangeable and transferable across all programs of its calibre. This means that any word processor (like google docs), of course following the Linux philosophy, would save the files in the same format.

### Technical Superiority
How Linux is powerful yet lightweight

````col
```col-md
#### MacOS
Install: 16-35GB
Boot time: 12s
```
```col-md
#### Arch Linux
Install: 1-5GB
Boot time: 5-8s
```

- Optimised and modular architecture
- Industry Gold standard

Next is simplicity. As I mentioned earlier, a modular approach is taken to handle portability. However, it too plays a role in simplicity as well. Each program should have one function and one function only. This allows that one program to get not only extremely good at that one thing, but also be small and optimised. This plays a large role in Linux's efficiency and speed in such a small package.

### Open Source Community
and why you should be a part of it

- Security
- Speedy Development
- Clean and optimised code

%%
Lastly, is control. In Linux, everything is under your own control if you want to. You could delete your whole computer in one command if you wanted to and nothing but yourself would stop you. But in Linux, everything is open sourced, this means that the original code is open for anyone to read and fix, contrary to how Mac has all of this hidden. Having open source code allows you to verify that what you want to be running is actually running and nothing extra, like data collection or ads.

### Why Mac just isn't that good

- Macs have a lot of bloat and features that you won't use
