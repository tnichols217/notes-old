	Stiff, Mary Roach, page 6.

3.  **Rhinoplasty**: Plastic surgery on the nose usually for cosmetic purposes  
	Stiff, Maty Roach, page 14.

5.  **Heyday**: The period of one's greatest popularity, vigor, or prosperity  
	Stiff, Mary Roach, page 26.  
	This sort of reasoned, pained sensitivity was rare in the heyday of British anatomy schools.

6.  **Quagmire**: soft miry land that shakes or yields under the foot  
	Stiff, Mary Roach, page 30.  
	…At the sight of that terrible charnel-house—fragments of limbs, the grinning heads and gaping skulls, the bloody quagmire underfoot and the atrocious smell it gave off,...  
	As Jack hiked through the forest, he stepped into a patch of quagmire, giving him a feeling of disgust.
	
7.  **Decedent**: a person who is no longer living : a deceased person  
	Stiff, Mary Roach, page 52.

	“Any cadaver is a decedent,” Jill explained at the front of class.
	
8.  **Protracted**: to prolong in time or space  
	Stiff, Mary Roach, page 52

9.  **Systole**: a rhythmically recurrent contraction  
	Stiff, Mary Roach, page 61  
	“If you insist on driving around in vintage cars with no seat belt on, try to time your crashes for the systole—blood-squeezed-out—portion of your heartbeat.”

10.  **Transect**: to cut transversely

12.  **Attenuate**: to lessen the amount, force, magnitude, or value of  
	Stiff, Mary Roach, page 102

	Airbags in cars greatly attenuate the impact force of a crash, if used correctly.
	
13.  **verisimilitude**: Something depicting realism  
	Stiff, Mary Roach, page 102  
	“As an added note of verisimilitude, each cadaver was outfitted head to toe in a regulation battle dress uniform.”  
	Even though the scene was not verisimilitude, it made sense to tone it down, as many people prefer not to view bloody scenes.
	
14.  **Lilt**: a springy buoyant movement  
	Stiff, Mary Roach, page 138  
	“Laborde didn't typically spend so much time personalizing his subjects, preferring to call them simply restes frais. The term means, literally, "fresh remains," though in French it has a pleasant culinary lilt, like something you might order off the specials board at the neighborhood bistro.”  
	Jill somehow managed to explain the science of dead people with a lilt to her voice.
	
15.  **Pugnacious**: having a quarrelsome or combative nature  
	Stiff, Mary Roach, page 147

	The caged dog eventually transformed into a pugnacious creature.
	
16.  **Mellify**: To embalm in honey  
	Stiff, Mary Roach, page 150

	Some old men were willing to be mellified alive to help treat other people’s illness.
	
17.  **Pious**: showing loyal reverence for a person or thing  
	Stiff, Mary Roach, page 158  
	“Chong describes a rather gruesome historical phenomenon wherein children, most often daughters-in-law, were obliged to demonstrate filial piety to ailing parents, most often mothers-in-law, by hacking off a piece of themselves and preparing it as a restorative elixir.”  
	All knights must be pious for their kings.
	
18.  **Veal**: the flesh of a young calf  
	Stiff, Mary Roach, page 168  
	“He estimates that humans have more or less the same body composition as veal.”

19.  **Vaudeville**: stage entertainment consisting of various acts (such as performing animals, comedians, or singers)  
	Stiff, Mary Roach, page 171  
	“A horse, bisected mid-torso, lies in halves on the floor, a vaudeville costume after the show.”  
	Watching all the surgeons lined up doing surgery on cadavers’ heads was like watching a mildly disturbing vaudeville.
	
20.  **Necropsie**: an autopsy performed on an animal  
	Stiff, Mary Roach, page 174

21.  **Miasma**: a vaporous exhalation formerly believed to cause disease  
	Stiff, Mary Roach, page 176  
	“hovering graveyard "miasmas" that tainted the air and sickened those who wandered past.”  
	It was widely believed that Jack released a miasma wherever he went, mysteriously killing plants where it wafted.
	
22.  **Putrescine**: a crystalline slightly poisonous ptomaine C4H12N2 that occurs in small amounts in virtually all living things  
	Stiff, Mary Roach, page 47  
	“Arpad's lab has rows of labeled glass vials: Skatole, Indole, Putrescine, Cadaverine”  
	As they sliced open the alien, vast amounts of putrescine spurted out, spreading itself all across the surgeon’s face, causing it to burn.
	
23.  **Skatole**: a foul-smelling compound C9H9N found in the intestines and feces, in civet, and in several plants or made synthetically and used in perfumes as a fixative  
	Stiff, Mary Roach, page 47  
	“The scientist jumped up and down excitedly, finally being able to extract skatole from human feces.
	
24.  **Indole**: a crystalline alkaloid compound C8H7N that is a decomposition product of proteins containing tryptophan, that can be made synthetically, and that is used in perfumes  
	Stiff, Mary Roach, page 47  
	“  
	A new natural perfume has been made using the naturally released indole from cadavers.
	
25.  **Cadaverine**: a syrupy colorless poisonous ptomaine C5H14N2 formed by decarboxylation of lysine especially in putrefaction of flesh  
	Stiff, Mary Roach, page 47  
	“  
	As the dead body lay there alone, cadaverine spewed out of the bulllethole, long after all the blood dried up.
	
26.  **Gross** Lab: a branch of anatomy that deals with the macroscopic structure of tissues and organs  
	Stiff, Mary Roach, page 12  
	“For most physicians, objectification is mastered their first year of medical school, in the gross anatomy lab, or "gross lab," as it is casually and somewhat aptly known.”  
	Intuitively, gross labs are somewhat gross to many people being a place where people learn to cut up flesh.
	
27.  **Autolysis**: breakdown of all or part of a cell or tissue by self-produced enzymes  
	Stiff, Mary Roach, page 42  
	“The hallmark of fresh-stage decay is a process called autolysis, or self-digestion.”  
	A relatively new method of disposing of bodies is called autolysis, where a certain bacteria is shoved down your mouth at which point it will digest your entire dead body.
	
28.  **Catheter**: a tubular medical device for insertion into canals, vessels, passageways, or body cavities usually to permit injection or withdrawal of fluids or to keep a passage open  
	Stiff, Mary Roach, page 20  
	“Before a cadaver is embalmed and delivered to the anatomy lab, it may pass an afternoon getting tracheal intubations and catheterizations.”  
	If you have trouble breathing, you may get a catherization.
	
29.  **Perineum**: an area between the thighs that marks the approximate lower boundary of the pelvis and is occupied by the urinary and genital ducts and rectum  
	Stiff, Mary Roach, page 18  
	“Another described the "horrible squash, squash of the forceps in the perineum."”  
	When Jone was young, he remembers being kicked in the perineum by a bully, leaving him doubled over crawling on the floor for a few minutes.
	
30.  **Malar**: of or relating to the cheek or the side of the head  
	Stiff, Mary Roach, page 16  
	“The blob is known among plastic surgeons as the malar fat pad.”
