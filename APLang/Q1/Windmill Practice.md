> Although wind energy is not for all locations around the world, its cost effectiveness, and cleanliness are unparalleled compared to other energy production methods; therefore, wind energy should not be belittled when envisioning the future of energy production. Wind energy may take up a lot of land and may not be suitable to be near to populated areas, but that does not make it any less valuable. There are plenty of area where setting up a wind farm is appropriate and unobtrusive to civilization. Wind energy also tends to be cheaper and cleaner than most other forms of energy generation

> Windmills cannot just be simply placed anywhere. There are certain areas where there simply is not enough consistent wind for it to be as effective as it could. According to Layton, "Wind turbines can't always run at 100 percent power like many other types of power plants, since wind speeds fluctuate." In areas like this, it may not be economically smart to place windmills there. Wind does tend to be less consistent than other forms of energy generation. Windmills also should not be positioned near highly populated areas. Windmill blades make a loud turbine noise, which is a periodic shoosh as the blades fly by. According to Source C, "This pulsing, uneven quality enables the noise to repeatedly capture the attention and become more difficult to ignore." These loud sounds are reportedly quite annoying and may cause nearby residents to lose quality in their sleep (Source B, C). These louds do not subside during the night
