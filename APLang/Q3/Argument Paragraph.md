Exploring the Unknown is an essential part of growth and learning. Without exploring unseen things, you will never explore and find new things you will like. Even though when you explore the unknown it may come with certain consequences such as getting hurt, its benefits of exposing you to a new world of opportunities is something worth sacrificing for. *insert quote of how people can get hurt here*. When exposing yourself to new things, it is highly likely you will run into something head on, not knowing what to expect. But these hurtful experiences are also essential to living a human life. Without both good and bad experiences, life would seemingly be repetitive and boring. **A while back, I went on my first hike. I never thought I would like it because it sounded hard and boring, as I had to go with a backpack as well. But as I went on it, I saw a world I never got to see up close before and I was in awe. But it too did come at a cost, I got cut, I was tired, and I almost got injured.** But these small injuries were only part of the journey to me loving going hiking and going to new places. Without ever even trying, I wouldn't have known that. The pains we go along the way are not an excuse to never try anything new. The troubles -- as well as the rewards -- are both part of living life and exploring new things.

title: **Intro**
Entertainment has many effects on the human society as a whole. For one, it helps spread new opinions and ideas and spread new discoveries. However, this ease of communication does come at a cost. Entertainment in general may often portray subethical things as fine for the sake of entertainment, leading the consumers to take on some of these traits. Entertainment has the capability to ruin our society though slowly changing the general population's mindset as a whole, and influencing our own thoughts and ideas.

Several good things have came out of entertainment, such as movies that raise awareness like "Megan was missing" or even something more simple like "Hidden Figures". This communication of ideas is definitely a good thing, but as it has great power to grant awareness and change your view on things, it also has the ability to change youre view the other way. For example, I find a lot of cool things through an entertainment-styled news channel, and I do get relevant things going on in the world
