# Modularity in Software Design

Dictionary.com defines modularity as having the property of being composed of "individually distinct functional units". For computer scientists this simply means that the software is being developed in modules, interconnecting to work together and serve a single purpose. These modules need not be developed by the same team and may instead be developed by groups of people who know nothing of each other's existence. Modularity allows developers to focus on one small portion of software and refine it until it performs its function excellently. This modular approach allows modules to be reusable, which cut down on costs and time. However, modularity may introduce a slight added complexity overall, but its benefits greatly outweight its costs, not only in individual complexity but in sustainability, progressivity, and reusability as a whole.
