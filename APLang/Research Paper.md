# The importance of Modularity in techonolgy
### Is 
**Modularity is an essential part of making technology maintainable, sustainable, and optimized.**

## Definitions
- Complexity can be defined as a function of the minimum number of individual parts needed in order for the system as a whole to function.
	- It is made up of multiple parts that interact in a nonsimple way
- Decomposabiliy may be part of the criterion of modularity in essence

## Modularity improves the maintainability of a system
- Ensures that no one person needs to understand the whole system to be able to make sure his part works
- Specialization at a particular thing: just get good at one thing, and focus on that. This is modularity in action, as many people work on their one specialized thing

	- a decomposable system may be able to limp along even if some subsystems are damaged or incomplete. 
	- Example: development of OS/360, having nondecomposible systems and a maintainence nightmare
	- Clearly, modularity is a design structure with a great many advantages. By reducing the degree of interdependency among, and thus the costs of communicating across, the parts of a system, it gives full rein to the many benefits of the division of labor among components. As usual, however, there is no free lunch. It turns out that modular systems are much more difficult to design than comparable interconnected systems. The designers of modular systems must know a great deal about the inner workings of the overall product or process in order to develop the visible design rules necessary to make the modules function as a whole. They have to specify those rules in advance. And while designs at the modular level are proceeding independently, it may seem that all is going well; problems with incomplete or imperfect modularization tend to appear only when the modules come together and work poorly as an integrated whole (Baldwin and Clark 1997, p. 86).
	- nondecomposability would dominate those of modularity only for some kinds of relatively stable systems where frequent change isnâ€™t important (10)
	- In a world of change, modularity is generally worth the costs. The real issue is normally not whether to be modular but how to be modular. (11)

	- The standardized modules would decrease the cost of a new robotic manipulator and eliminate the possibility of obsolescence - the module can be upgraded when a better model becomes available. The small, standardized modules could be improved less expensively than a whole new robot arm, allowing the robotic industry to make "tech mods" rapidly and take advantage of the most advanced technology. The final result would be a rapidly growing, efficient industry whose impact on manufacturing would rival the impact of the microchip on the field of electronics.
	- Portability of a robotic system implies that it can be broken down into pieces (or modules) small enough to be carried to the work place by a human operator and quickly assembled.
	- Failure in a robotic system might mean the high cost of total replacement. This maintenance objective would best be met by using robots made up of modules which could be easily replaced. Redundancy in some of the hardware components (sensors, encoders, local microprocessors, etc.) can be helpful.
	- The modularity approach will allow aggressive upgrading programs to be pursued in almost all major areas.
