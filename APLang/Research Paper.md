# The importance of Modularity in techonolgy
### Is 
**Modularity is an essential part of making technology maintainable, sustainable, and optimized.**

## Definitions
- Complexity can be defined as a function of the minimum number of individual parts needed in order for the system as a whole to function.
	- It is made up of multiple parts that interact in a nonsimple way
- Decomposabiliy may be part of the criterion of modularity in essence

## Modularity improves the maintainability of a system
- Ensures that no one person needs to understand the whole system to be able to make sure his part works
- Specialization at a particular thing: just get good at one thing, and focus on that. This is modularity in action, as many people work on their one specialized thing

	- a decomposable system may be able to limp along even if some subsystems are damaged or incomplete. 
	- Example: development of OS/360, having nondecomposible systems and a maintainence nightmare
	- Clearly, modularity is a design structure with a great many advantages. By reducing the degree of interdependency among, and thus the costs of communicating across, the parts of a system, it gives full rein to the many benefits of the division of labor among components. As usual, however, there is no free lunch. It turns out that modular systems are much more difficult to design than comparable interconnected systems. The designers of modular systems must know a great deal about the inner workings of the overall product or process in order to develop the visible design rules necessary to make the modules function as a whole. They have to specify those rules in advance. And while designs at the modular level are proceeding independently, it may seem that all is going well; problems with incomplete or imperfect modularization tend to appear only when the modules come together and work poorly as an integrated whole (Baldwin and Clark 1997, p. 86).
