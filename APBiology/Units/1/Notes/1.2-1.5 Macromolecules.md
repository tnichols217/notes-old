> [!def]
> Macromolecules are made of Polymers

> [!def]
> **Polymers** are made of a chain of Monomers
>> [!def]
>> **Dehydration**: The binding of multiple monomers to form a polymer by removing extra $H_2O$.
>> One monomer loses a $H$ and the other loses an $OH$
>
>> [!def]
>> **Hydrolysis**: The separation of a polymer into its monomers by adding $H_2O$
>> One chain receives a $H$ and the other receives an $OH$
